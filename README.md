# _EPCM Dashboard Project_

### _Project Overview_
This project develops a centralized EPCM Dashboard designed to track and visualize key performance metrics in the context of Engineering, Procurement, and Construction Management (EPCM). The dashboard consolidates project data to provide faster insights into project performance, resource allocation, procurement status, safety incidents, and deliverable compliance. This solution helps EPCM teams deliver projects on time, within scope, and within budget, while maintaining high safety and quality standards.

### _Business Context_
EPCM companies specialize in providing end-to-end project solutions for energy, chemical, mining, infrastructure, and industrial sectors. The dashboard directly supports the companyâ€™s mission to deliver innovative, cost-effective, and timely engineering and project services. It helps EPCM teams focus on critical metrics such as schedule variance, project cost performance (CPI), procurement variance, and safety incidents, which are all crucial for improving decision-making, resource allocation, and overall project success.

### _Key Features_
1. Comprehensive KPI Tracking: The dashboard includes metrics like total cost, schedule variance, CPI, SPI, project status, incident trends, and PO variance.
2. Interactive Visualizations: Displays data in intuitive formats like stacked bar charts, line charts, and tables, with drill-down capabilities for deeper insights.
3. Project Health Monitoring: Tracks deliverable status, identifies underperforming projects, and highlights areas needing attention.
4. Proactive Decision Making: Helps project managers, procurement specialists, and safety coordinators make real-time adjustments to improve project outcomes.

### _Technologies Used_
- Power BI: For dashboard creation and data visualization.
- DAX: For KPI calculations and performance metrics.
- Power Query: Used to clean, transform, and model the data.

### _Business Needs Addressed by the Dashboard_
This dashboard helps the EPCM company in the following ways:
1. Faster Insights: Enables decision-makers to get quick insights on project status, timelines, and costs.
2. Improved Forecasting: Reduces delays and overspending by tracking key metrics such as schedule variance and procurement issues.
3. Better Resource Allocation: Tracks resource utilization to ensure that no team member is overburdened or underutilized.
4. Enhanced Safety Tracking: Helps safety officers monitor and investigate incidents, ensuring a safer project environment.

### _Device and Accessibility Requirements_
- Device: Primarily consumed via desktop (Power BI Desktop and Power BI Service).
- Accessibility: No specific accessibility needs were outlined, but the interface is designed to be intuitive and user-friendly for easy adoption by different stakeholders.

### _Conclusion and Next Steps_
The EPCM Dashboard centralizes project insights and provides a single source of truth for all project performance metrics. This solution contributes to the company's overall strategy by improving the speed of decision-making, enhancing safety outcomes, and optimizing resource utilization across projects.
